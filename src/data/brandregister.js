      question: "What are the reasons to register my logo in the UAE?",
      answer:
        "Registering your logo (trademark) gives you exclusive legal rights to use and enforce the mark nationwide, deters copying, enables enforcement through courts and customs, allows licensing or assignment, lets you use the ® symbol after registration, and strengthens brand value and customer trust.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What is the typical time duration for logo (trademark) registration?",
      answer:
        "A standard, uncontested registration typically completes in about 6–12 months from filing. The process includes formalities, substantive examination, publication (opposition) period and issuance. Oppositions or objections can extend the timeline to 12–18 months or longer.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I register a trade name in English and Arabic?",
      answer:
        "For a company trade name (trade license), an Arabic version is required on official records; an English translation is usually allowed but Arabic is the authoritative form. For trademarks (logos/word marks) you can register in any script—if you use both Arabic and English publicly, it’s advisable to register both versions to maximize protection.",
