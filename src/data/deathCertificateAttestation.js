      question: "Why do I need death certificate attestation in the UAE?",

        "It is required for legal and administrative procedures such as property transfer, insurance claims, repatriation, cancelling visas, and other legal status changes.",
    },
    {
      question: "Who typically needs a death certificate attested?",
      answer:
        "Relatives, estate executors, banks, insurance companies, immigration authorities, and legal representatives who must process claims or change legal records in the UAE.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does the attestation process usually take?",

    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to be physically present for the attestation?",
      answer:

    },
    {
      question: "Is notarization required before embassy attestation?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Notarization by a licensed notary in the issuing country is generally the first step before any embassy or ministry-level legalization.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is translation necessary for a death certificate?",
      answer:
        "If the certificate is not in English or Arabic, a certified translation is normally required before embassy or MOFA attestation. We can arrange translations if needed.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can a death certificate issued overseas be attested for use in Dubai?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. GoKite PRO coordinates with the issuing country’s notary, relevant ministries, the UAE embassy/consulate, and MOFA to complete the attestation chain.",
    },
    {
      question: "What documents are required to start the attestation?",
      answer:
        "Typically the original death certificate, passport copy of the deceased, passport copy of the applicant/relative, any death report or supporting documents, and an authorization letter if a representative handles the process.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if the original death certificate is lost or damaged?",
      answer:
        "We can guide you on obtaining a certified duplicate from the issuing authority and then proceed with the standard attestation steps.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will an attested death certificate be accepted internationally?",
      answer:
        "Yes — once fully attested (including MOFA and embassy steps where applicable), the certificate is legally recognized for official use in the UAE and broadly accepted for international legal/administrative matters.",
