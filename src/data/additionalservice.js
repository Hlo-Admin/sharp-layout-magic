      answer:
        "Registering your logo (trademark) gives you exclusive legal rights to use and enforce the mark across the UAE, deters copying and unauthorized use, enables enforcement through courts and customs, allows licensing or assignment, permits use of the ® symbol after registration, and strengthens brand value and customer trust.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What is the typical time duration for logo (trademark) registration?",
      answer:
        "A standard, uncontested registration typically completes in about 6–12 months from filing. The timeline includes formality checks, substantive examination, publication (opposition) period and issuance; oppositions or objections can extend the process.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a registered logo last?",
      answer:
        "A registered trademark in the UAE is valid for 10 years from the filing date and can be renewed indefinitely for subsequent 10‑year periods by paying the renewal fees.",
