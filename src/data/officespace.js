      question: "How long does real estate name registration take in Dubai?",
      answer:
        "Name reservation via Dubai authorities or free‑zone portals is usually approved within a few hours to 1–2 business days. Full name registration as part of licence issuance typically completes in 3–10 business days depending on required approvals and document readiness.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use any name for my real estate company?",
      answer:
        "No. The name must be unique and comply with UAE naming rules: no offensive, religious or governmental references, no names of public figures or existing companies, and it must include the legal form (e.g., LLC). Authorities may require an Arabic version and can reject non‑compliant names.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "Is real estate name registration mandatory for all firms in this sector?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Any business operating in the real estate sector must reserve and register a trade name and obtain the appropriate licence/registration (e.g., RERA registration or licence under the relevant authority). Operating without proper registration can result in fines, blocked transactions or closure.",
